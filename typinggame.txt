........my story...........
Long ago there lived
a woodcutter in a small village
He was sincere
in his work and
very honest
Every day he
set out into the
nearby forest
to cut trees
He brought the woods
back into the
village and sold
them out
to a merchant
and earn his money
He earned just about
enough to make
a living but
he was satisfied
with his simple
living
One day
while cutting a
tree near a 
his axe slipped
out of his
hand and fell
into the river
The river was so deep
he could not
retrive his axe
he was very sad
he pleaded to god
to give back his 
axe he was crying
after a long 
time a water god
appeared infront
and asked him 
why he was crying
he told his 
axe fell
the water god
showed a golden 
axe and asked
if it was his
then the 
woodcutter said no
then water god 
was pleased and
he handed him 
his axe along
with the golden
axe woodcutter was
happy and 
he remained honest
for the rest of 
his life
