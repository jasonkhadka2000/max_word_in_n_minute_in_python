Long ago there lived
a woodcutter in a small village
He was sincere
in his work and
very honest
Every day he
set out into the
nearby forest
to cut trees
He brought the woods
back into the
village and sold
them out
to a merchant
and earn his money
He earned just about
enough to make
a living but
he was satisfied
with his simple
living
One day
while cutting a
tree near a 
his axe slipped
out of his
hand and fell
into the river
The river was so deep
